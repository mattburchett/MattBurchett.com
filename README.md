JupiterColony
=============

Collaborative design of the JupiterColony landing page, a repository for the site and for design documents/goals.

Notes
=====
Both active branches welcome merge requests tha make sense. @rikai and @ChrisLAS have final say on design decisions.

* The master branch will contain style and content documents to help focus the direction, as this is a community effort.
* The gh-pages branch contains the actual site, and is what pull requests for changes to the live site should be filed against.
